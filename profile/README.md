# 👋 Hi, This is WMYM-Experimental by [@WashingtonYandun](https://github.com/WashingtonYandun).

[![](https://visitcount.itsvg.in/api?id=WMYM-Experimental&label=Profile%20Views&color=0&icon=5&pretty=true)](https://visitcount.itsvg.in)

These repos are made by ( [@WashingtonYandun](https://github.com/WashingtonYandun) ) 

## 🏬 Why a Github org?

- This is my "can of repos", these are repositories that i dont want to have on my profile but i made in the past (or made in the present for fun).
- So here you can find many begginer projects or repos with no much importance/relevance.

## 👀 What you can find in here (mostly):

- Repos created for fun. (Tiny things for fun, learn or both). 
- University projects / Homework. 
- Repos created for learning stuff (Experiments)
